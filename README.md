# NumberGuessingGame
This bash script allows for a user to guess a number within the given range and hints if the next guess needs to be higher or lower based on the previous guss until the random number generated is correctly answered. It keeps a scoreboard of the user and the amount of tries it took to correctly guess the random number.
